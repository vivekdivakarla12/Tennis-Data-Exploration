### First Serve Statistics
The first statistic I chose to make was a "first serve dominance rating". This statistic shows the first serve points won% from the match winner minus the first serve points won% from the loser of the match. The idea is to see how much better the winner was on first serve than the loser. The graph below shows the statistics from all 65 wins of Carlos Alcaraz's season. Alcaraz is the world #2 and a great player, but his wins this season came in a variety of ways. He had some dominant performances, including a 6-0 6-2 win over Facundo Bagnis where he won 81% of his first serves, compared to 34% for Bagnis. On the contrary, he had seven matches where he was able to win despite his opponent winning a higher percentage of their first serves, meaning he was able to deliver performances in crucial moments, and isn't completely reliant on his first serve like other players.
